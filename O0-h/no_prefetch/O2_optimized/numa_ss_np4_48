--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following command line option and corresponding MCA parameter have
been deprecated and replaced as follows:

  Command line option:
    Deprecated:  --bind-to-core
    Replacement: --bind-to core

  Equivalent MCA parameter:
    Deprecated:  hwloc_base_bind_to_core
    Replacement: hwloc_base_binding_policy=core

The deprecated forms *will* disappear in a future version of Open MPI.
Please update to the new syntax.
